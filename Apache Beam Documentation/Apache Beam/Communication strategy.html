On blog (a), there is a blog published every month, except for months where there are new releases or Beam summits, when the frequency increases to 3 blog posts a month. On blog (b) there were 3 blog posts published.</p><p><strong>Proposed change:</strong><span> </span>remove blogging space (b) and focus on maintaining blogging space (a). In addition, incorporate the following categories for blogging:</p><ul><li><p>Blogs about Beam Summit.

The goal is to give more visibility to different use cases for Beam.</p><ul><li>Reasoning: currently, the only medium for Beam use cases are videos. By sharing use cases in blog format, we make this content more accessible for users, as well as discoverable to search queries.</li><li>Frequency: 1 blog post every three months, 4 blog posts a year.</li></ul></li><li><p>Your journey as a contributor. The goal is to increase the visibility on Beam contributors, and shed light on how the transition takes place from users to contributors.</p><ul><li>Reasoning: by describing the change from a role to another, we make this journey more relatable and accessible to new users, motivating them to become contributors sooner. At the moment, all the content connected to raising awareness about contributing to the project is rather dry and impersonal. By featuring a contributor, we bring this role closer to the community of users.</li><li>Frequency: 1 blog post every two months, 6 blog posts a year.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="Communicationstrategy-trainingsProposal2:Developmorein-personanddigitalworkshops"><a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/macruzbar/beam/blob/master/channels%20and%20communication%20strategy/Communication-strategy.md#proposal-2-develop-more-in-person-and-digital-workshops" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;"><span class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" data-hasbody="false" data-macro-name="anchor" id="Communicationstrategy-trainings"> </span></a>Proposal 2: Develop more in-person and digital workshops</h3><p><strong>Current status:</strong><span> </span>Up until now, workshops have been tested only in in-person events at Beam Summit NA 2019, and Cumbre de Contribuidores de Open Source Software 2019 (CCOSS) in Mexico. Workshops are also in high demand for meetups and more informal events.</p><p><strong>Proposed change:</strong><span> </span>develop content for workshops that focus on how to use Beam, and workshops that focus on how to contribute to Beam.</p><ul><li>Reasoning: at the moment, there is very little content supporting the conversion of users into contributors. Furthermore, workshops are only in-person, which means that only people who attend Apache Beam events can access these resources. By digitizing this content, and distributing it on the front page of the project (Apache Beam website), we make it more accessible to users, supporting the short term outcome of increasing awareness on how to contribute to the project, and accelerating the journey from user to contributor.</li></ul><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macruzbar/beam/master/channels%20and%20communication%20strategy/apache-beam-trainings.png" data-image-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macruzbar/beam/master/channels%20and%20communication%20strategy/apache-beam-trainings.png"></span></p><ul><li>Distribution: Document workshops on Github repository, record workshops and publish on Youtube.
