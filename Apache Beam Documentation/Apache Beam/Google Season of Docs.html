<p><span>The Beam community is applying to Season of Docs! </span></p><p><span><div class="toc-macro client-side-toc-macro  conf-macro output-block" data-hasbody="false" data-headerelements="H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6,H7" data-macro-name="toc"> </div></span></p><p><span><a class="external-link" href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/" rel="nofollow">Season of Docs</a></span><span> is a program organized by <a class="external-link" href="https://opensource.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Open Source</a></span><span> to match technical writers with mentors to work on documentation for open source projects. We, at Apache Beam, couldn’t be more excited about this opportunity, because as a small, and fast growing project, we need to make sure that our documentation stays up to date, and in good condition.</span></p><p><span>Together with the community, we have gathered a set of projects that we would love a technical writer to work on. In fact, we have asked for two technical writers in our application, as we believe there is a big interest in the community, and lots of work to be done.</span></p><p><span>If you like the idea of spending a few months working in our awesome open source project, in a welcoming community that will be thrilled to see your contributions, please take a look at the projects list, and consider applying for Season of Docs. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to us in the Apache Beam mailing list at </span><a class="external-link" href="mailto:dev@beam.apache.org" rel="nofollow"><span>dev@beam.apache.org</span></a><span> (you will need to subscribe first by emailing </span><a class="external-link" href="mailto:dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org" rel="nofollow"><span>dev-subscribe@beam.apache.org</span></a><span>)</span><span>. Our team of mentors will be happy to answer any of your question, and </span><span>we are looking forward to hearing from you &lt;3</span></p><h1 id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-WhatisApacheBeam?"><span>What is Apache Beam?</span></h1><p><span><a class="external-link" href="https://beam.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Apache Beam</a> is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beam’s supported distributed processing back-ends, which include Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, IBM Streams and Google Cloud Dataflow.</span></p><p><span>Beam is particularly useful for Embarrassingly Parallel data processing tasks, in which the problem can be decomposed into many smaller bundles of data that can be processed independently and in parallel. You can also use Beam for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tasks and pure data integration. These tasks are useful for moving data between different storage media and data sources, transforming data into a more desirable format, or loading data onto a new system.</span></p><p><span>Apache Beam has a number of top-level SDKs that allow you to write pipelines: Java, Python, and Go; as well as a number of DSLs built on top of these SDKs: SQL, Scala, and a fluent Java interface.</span></p><h2 id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-WhyApply?"><span>Why Apply?</span></h2><p>Apache Beam  <span>has a healthy community around it, with </span><a class="external-link" href="https://projects.apache.org/committee.html?beam" rel="nofollow"><span>70 committers</span></a><span> from different organizations! B</span><span>eing one of the </span><a class="external-link" href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache-in-2019-by-the" rel="nofollow"><span>top 5 </span><span>out of all 350 Apache projects</span></a><span> by number of commits, the code base of the project has been steadily growing. Overtime, as the code base grew, the amount of new features that documentation did not cover has also grown. We see the GSoD program as a great opportunity to welcome more technical writers to the project and help them grow into valuable members of the community.</span></p><h2 style="text-align: left;" id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-Projectideas"><span>Project ideas</span></h2><h3 style="text-align: left;" id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-1.DeploymentofaFlinkandSparkClusterswithPortableBeam"><span>1. Deployment of a Flink and Spark Clusters with Portable Beam</span></h3><h4 style="text-align: left;" id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-Projectdescription"><span>Project description</span></h4><p style="text-align: left;"><span>The Apache Beam vision has been to provide a framework for users to write and execute pipelines on the programming language of your choice, and the runner of your choice. As the reality of Beam has evolved towards this vision, the way in which Beam is run on top of runners such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink has changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span>These changes are documented in the wiki and in design documents, and are accessible for Beam contributors; but they are not available in the user-facing documentation. This has been a barrier of adoption for other users of Beam.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: left;" id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-Projectdeliverables"><span>Project deliverables</span></h4><p style="text-align: left;"><span>This project involves improving the Flink Runner page[1] to include strategies to deploy Beam on a few different environments: A Kubernetes cluster, a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster, and an AWS EMR cluster. There are other places in the documentation that should be updated with new documentation in this regard[4][5].</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span>After working on the Flink Runner, then similar updates should be made to the Spark Runner page[2], and the getting started documentation[3].</span></p><h4 style="text-align: left;" id="GoogleSeasonofDocs-ProjectBackgroundMaterials"><strong>Project Background</strong> <strong>Materials</strong></h4><p style="text-align: left;">There currently are a number of users of the Apache Beam portable runners, and there have been a few different writeups, and attempts at summarizing how to easily run Apache Beam on the different runners. Some examples are:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li style="text-align: left;">A guide for running Beam on Flink with the k8s operator developed by Google[6]</li><li style="text-align: left;">A few issues from users asking about running Beam in one of these runners
